Feature: lock should propagate correctly if a share is reshared

  @issue-36064
  Scenario Outline: public uploads to a reshared share that was locked by original owner
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And the administrator has enabled DAV tech_preview
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Brian" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Carol" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "PARENT" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has shared folder "PARENT (2)" with user "Carol"
    And user "Carol" has created a public link share of folder "PARENT (2)" with change permission
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When the public uploads file "test.txt" with content "test" using the old public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/test.txt" should not exist
    #When the public uploads file "test.txt" with content "test" using the new public WebDAV API
    #Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    #And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/test.txt" should not exist
    When the public uploads file "test.txt" with content "test" using the new public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/test.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | lock-scope |
      | shared     |
      | exclusive  |
