Enhancement: Persistent major file version workflow

Restore operation logic changed. Now restore is creating new current version of the file - including the fact that it creates new mtime for the file) - from one of past noncurrent versions of the file. The old noncurrent version is no longer removed upon restore
The current version of the file is now shown in the Versions Tab, highlighted with "gray" background.
Versions now persist additional extended metadata on versioning tags, that allow easier identification of the versions. Each update increases minor version for the file
Current version of the file now can be published, which increases major version tag. 
Each new edit of the file would create noncurrent versions tagged with major version, which persist version long term and it wont be subject to any retention policies
