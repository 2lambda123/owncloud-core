Bugfix: Scrollable Login screen

Current login screen has an always visible scrollbar to prevent a "jumping" of the login form. 
Certain constallations of notices and error messages can exceed the screens height which 
will result in a horiztonal jump of the login form (when scrollbar is added). Until now this 
was done via setting a height of 101% which made the scrollbar always visible - but also scrollable. 
This fix makes the scrollbar visible any time but not scrollable if not needed.
