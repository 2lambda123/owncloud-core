Enhancement: Setting for recursive extra config.php search

Before this change extra config.php files were required to be placed directly in the config folder.
This change allows to have nested folders configuration structure, 
enabled by config value OC_CONFIG_EXTRA_RECURSIVE_SEARCH, that can be useful in some deployments.

NOTE: due to the fact that `config_extra_recursive_search` setting controls the configuration itself, 
it is only possible to enable this via environment variable. It is not possible to enable it with *.config.php file.
