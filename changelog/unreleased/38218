Enhancement: Improve error messages for invalid file names

When using blacklisted or excluded filenames, you just get a default error
message that you do not have permissions to write there (basis is 403). This is
confusing because of the missing reason. Applies when you drag and drop a file
into the browser. With this change, a proper error message is shown to the user.
