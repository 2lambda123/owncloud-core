Bugfix: Fix potential issue with the PreviewCleanup job in postgresql

One of the filters of the preview cleanup job requires casting a filename,
which is supposed to contain only digits, to an integer. The expected execution
of the DB query should have filtered the results so the condition above should
be true, but the DB's query planner might choose to apply the filters in a
different way, so we could potentially cast random strings to integer.
For the case of postgresql, the cast function will cause an error if the string
can't be casted to an integer (because it has non-digit chars, for example)

This situation is fixed for all the supported DBs, so we don't require the
query planner to execute the query in any particular way.
