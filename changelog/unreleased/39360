Enhancement: Added needed code for webp thumbnail generation to occur.

Previously thumbnail previews for image files of the webp format with the
.webp extension were not generated.  Instead a generic placeholder icon was
shown.  This enhancement/fix caused the generation of preview thumbnails,
just as was standard with other image formats.

The text in the paragraphs is written in past tense. The last section is a list
of issue URLs, PR URLs and other URLs. The first issue ID (or the first PR ID,
in case there aren't any issue links) is used as the primary ID.
