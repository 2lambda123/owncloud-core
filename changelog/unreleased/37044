Bugfix: Fix Google drive files without extension 404

Seemingly for at least the past two years, any Google Drive files without a file extension (".git/HEAD" for example) would result in a 404 response from the Web UI or desktop client. This bug was a result of a dot being appended to filename without a trailing extension. This fix simply doesn't append a trailing dot if file has no extension.
