Bugfix: Fix expiration date and eliminate duplicate entries in file list

We've addressed two visual issues in the web ui file list. 
Firstly, the problem where the start of the epoch was mistakenly displayed as an expiration date in the shared file list
has been resolved.
Secondly, we've tackled the pesky bug causing duplicate entries to appear when switching between shared tabs and
clicking on a file list entry.
