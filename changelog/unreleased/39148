Change: Remove misleading tag edit/trash actions

This PR's removes the edit/delete actions from the tag selection list.
While those actions are only visible to the admin it is still a very misleading 
way since users think they remove a tag from a file but instead delete it completely. 
This can have bad consequences, for example breaking retention policies.
