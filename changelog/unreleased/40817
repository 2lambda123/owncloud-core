Bugfix: Fix is_writable check when file is on an NFS mount

The is_writable function seems to function improperly when operating on NFS mounts.
Although the mount is writable by the executing user, PHP falsely states that it is not writable.
This change introduces a workaround which will attempt to write a temporary file to the data directory
and detect the write permission by testing for the file's existence.
