Change: Don't enable incoming federated share requests by default

Federated share requests can be used for spamming the user with unwanted shares.
Therefore, we decided to disable incoming federated share requests by default.

Please revise your setting under Settings > Admin > Sharing > Federation
> Allow users on this server to receive shares from other servers
