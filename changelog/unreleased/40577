Enhancement: Add support for OCM via ScienceMesh


We've added an if-statement in the files_sharing ShareesController
code that searches for remote sharees. When `sharing.remoteShareesSearch`
defines a plugin that implements `IRemoteShareesSearch`, for instance the
'ScienceMeshSearchPlugin' from the 'sciencemesh' app or similar,
use it instead of the federatedfilesharing app to find sharee matches for
OCM sharing.
