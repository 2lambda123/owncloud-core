Bugfix: Fix behavior for foobar (in present tense, max length 80 chars)

The is_writable function seems to function improperly when operating on NFS mounts. Although the mount is writable by the executing user, Php falsely states that it is not writable.
This change introduces a workaround which will attempt to write a temporary file to the data directory
and detecting the write permission by testing for the file's existence.
