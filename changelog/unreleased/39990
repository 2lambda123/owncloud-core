Bugfix: Upload chunks might not get cleaned up if data is missing from the DB

There might be cases where the upload data has been removed from the DB, but
the chunks are still present in the FS.
Previously, those chunks couldn't be cleaned up normally, so you had to remove
them manually.
Now, with the help of the "-l" option, a scan will be performed to ensure the
data is present in the DB before performing the cleanup operation.
