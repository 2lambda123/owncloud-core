Bugfix: Hash chunk(v2) filename

Before this PR, while uploading a file, chunks(v2) were created with filename
consist of original filename plus chunk suffix.
This could lead to a too long filename error.
With this PR the chunk filenames consist of md5 hash and chunk suffix, which
decreases the filename and prevents a too long filename error.

The implementation also provides a way to retrieve meta data of a
part file. This way, the original file path or name can be fetched.
