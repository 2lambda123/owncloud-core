Feature: File Upload

  As a user
  I would like to be able to upload files via the WebUI
  So that I can store files in ownCloud

  Background:
    Given user "user1" has been created
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: simple upload of a file that does not exist before
    When the user uploads the file "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI
    Then no notification should be displayed on the webUI
    And the file "new-lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    And the content of "new-lorem.txt" should be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"

  # disabled due to random fails
  #@smokeTest
  Scenario: chunking upload
    Given a file with the size of "30000000" bytes and the name "big-video.mp4" has been created locally
    When the user uploads the file "big-video.mp4" using the webUI
    Then no notification should be displayed on the webUI
    And the file "big-video.mp4" should be listed on the webUI
    And the content of "big-video.mp4" should be the same as the local "big-video.mp4"

  Scenario: conflict with a chunked file
    Given a file with the size of "30000000" bytes and the name "big-video.mp4" has been created locally
    When the user renames the file "lorem.txt" to "big-video.mp4" using the webUI
    And the user uploads overwriting the file "big-video.mp4" using the webUI and retries if the file is locked
    Then the file "big-video.mp4" should be listed on the webUI
    And the content of "big-video.mp4" should be the same as the local "big-video.mp4"

  Scenario: upload a new file into a sub folder
    When the user opens the folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
