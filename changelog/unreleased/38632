Bugfix: Catch potential error which renders the settings page inaccessible

canChangeAvatar may throw an exception when LDAP is used. This makes the
profile page inaccessible causing the settings link in the main view to break.
The exception itself might be caused by some kind of misconfiguration which
we are investigating.
