Bugfix: LDAP groups will be properly applied to external storages

The admin can setup external storages to be used by specific users and groups.
When a LDAP group was setup, there were some issues so users belonging to
that group weren't able to access the external storage even though they
should.

Now, users belonging to LDAP groups can access external storages configured
to be accessed by those groups.
